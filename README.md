# FT8 Off Rules

**Times – Weekly / Times to be announced**

OBJECTIVE
For amateurs around the world to make as many contacts as possible in a one hour period while having a good time. The goal is to face off against a friend, a group of people, and/or other Youtubers

BANDS
As this is not an official contest, any band/frequency which allows FT8 is permitted.

TWO TRANSMITTERS
A maximum of TWO Transmitters may be used at any given time during the competition. Total output power must not exceed **1500 watts** on any band at any time, anything above 100 Watts makes you a WAR CRIMINAL.

AWARDS
In the future, multiple awards may be offered. The plan or thought is to have two different awards: Multiband competition awards and single band. Awards can be done in certificate format or in prize format. Awards can also be fun. Any recommendations for awards may be considered.

CERTIFICATES
No certificates are granted at this current moment.

PRIZES
In the future, Prizes may be given out for tournament winners. This will be updated when further information becomes available.

CLUB COMPETITION
In the world of Amateur Radio Sports Contests, this is currently an individual contest. Plans to make club tournaments will be added in the future.

Participants
Anyone with an Amateur Radio Callsign anywhere is welcome to participate. Additionally, anyone being supervised by someone with a valid callsign is considered eligible under that Callsign. One supervised individual per competition.

DEFINITION OF TERMS

Station location - The area in which all the transmitters, receivers, and antennas are located. All transmitters and receivers must be within a single 500-meter diameter circle. Antennas must be physically connected by RF transmission lines to the transmitters and receivers.

Grid Field - The first two characters of the Maidenhead locator system. Each character is a letter from A-R for a total of 324 Grid Fields defining the world. These are used for multipliers on each band.

Grid Square - The first four characters of the Maidenhead locator system. The first two characters are the Field as defined above. The second two characters are each a digit from 0-9 for a total of 32,400Grid Squares defining the world. These are used in the exchange and for determining QSO points.

GENERAL RULES FOR ALL ENTRANTS

  1. Entrants must operate within the limits of their chosen category when performing any activity that could impact their submitted score.
  2. A different call sign must be used for each entry. Only the entrant’s call sign may be used to aid the entrant’s score.
  3. Do not exceed the total output power limitation of the chosen entry category on any band. Total output power on any band at any time is measured at the output of the active amplifier(s).
  4. Self-spotting or asking to be spotted is permitted.
  5. Remote operation is permitted if all transmitters, receivers, and antennas are personally owned by you.
  6. A remotely operated station must obey all station licenses, operator licenses, and category limitations. The call sign used must be the one issued or permitted by the Regulatory Authority of the station location.
  7. Remote receivers outside the station location are not permitted.
  8. Alternating CQs on two or more frequencies on a band is not permitted.
  9. All requests for contacts, responses to calls, and copying of callsigns and contest exchanges must be accomplished during the contest period using the mode and frequencies of the contest.
  10. Correction of logged call signs and exchanges after the contest, by use of any database, recordings, email, or other methods is not allowed.
  11. Call signs logged must be the same as those exchanged over the air by the entrants during the QSO.
  12. Currently, only FT-8 is permitted. Future plans to implement SSB, CW, FT-4, and other modes may become available after the implementation and evaluation of FT-8 modes.
  13. Each QSO must require some action by the operator, e.g., selecting a QSO partner.

LOG INSTRUCTIONS
Electronic submission of logs is **required** for all entrants.

  1. The log MUST show the following for each contact:
        Correct date and time in UTC and must be within the time frame of the contest
        Frequency (or band)
        The call sign of the station worked
        Exchange sent
        Exchange received
  2. A log without all required information may be invalidated. Contacts should be logged at the time they are completed.
  3. Single-band entrants are required to include all contacts made during the contest period, even if on other bands. Logs with contacts only on one band will be classified as single band entries unless the operator is operating in a tournament-style contest which does not specifically state it is a single band tournament.
  4. The standard way to submit logs currently is to send the contents of the ADIF/ADI file via E-Mail.
  5. Email is the current required method of log submission. Email is your logs in ADI/ADIF format to hrd@atfguy.com.

  2. Contacts with an incorrectly received exchange are removed.
  3. Call sign errors (bust) or call signs, not in the other log (NIL) are removed and receive a penalty of the QSO point value for that contact.
