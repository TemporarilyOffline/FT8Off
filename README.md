For amateurs around the world to make as many contacts as possible in a one hour period while having a good time. The goal is to face off against a friend, a group of people, and/or other Youtubers

**BANDS: As this is not an official contest, any band/frequency which allows FT8 is permitted.**

**One Transmitter:**
A maximum of ONE Transmitter may be used at any given time during the competition. Contestants MUST indicate if they have switched Transmitters during the competition. A maximum of two different transmitters may be used during the span of each contest/competition, if they are not used together. Once a transmitter has been deemed swapped or replaced, it may not be used for the rest of the competition/contest. Total output power must not exceed **1500 watts** on any band at anytime, anything above 1500 Watts makes you a WAR CRIMINAL.

**AWARDS:**
In the future, multiple awards may be offered. The plan or thought is to have two different awards: Multiband competition awards and single band. Awards can be done certificate format or in prize format. Awards can also be fun. Any recommendations for awards may be considered.

No certificates are granted at this current moment.

**Prizes:**
In the future, Prizes may be given out for tournament winners. This will be updated when further information becomes available.
